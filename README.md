## Stages in consumer decision making process ??

Stages in the Consumer Decision-Making Process üõçÔ∏è

The consumer decision-making process is a structured journey that a consumer follows before purchasing a product or service. It consists of five key stages:

1. Need Recognition (Problem Identification)
	‚Ä¢	The process starts when the consumer realizes a need or problem.
	‚Ä¢	This need can be triggered by internal factors (hunger, thirst, fashion trends) or external factors (advertisements, peer influence).
	‚Ä¢	Example: You realize your old phone is slow and needs replacement.

2. Information Search
	‚Ä¢	The consumer looks for solutions and information about available options.
	‚Ä¢	Sources of information:
	‚Ä¢	Internal Search: Past experiences, memory.
	‚Ä¢	External Search: Friends, online reviews, advertisements, influencers.
	‚Ä¢	Example: You browse online reviews, visit stores, and watch YouTube comparisons.

3. Evaluation of Alternatives
	‚Ä¢	Consumers compare different brands/products based on features, price, quality, and benefits.
	‚Ä¢	They may use:
	‚Ä¢	Compensatory Decision Rule ‚Äì trade-offs (e.g., higher price but better quality).
	‚Ä¢	Non-Compensatory Rule ‚Äì strict criteria (e.g., only considering a brand with 5G).

	‚Ä¢	Dissatisfied ‚Üí Complaints, product returns, negative reviews.
	‚Ä¢	Example: If the iPhone meets expectations, you recommend it to friends. If not, you leave a bad review.

## Types of Memory

Types of Memory in Consumer Behavior üß†

In Consumer Behavior, memory plays a crucial role in how consumers perceive, retain, and recall information about brands, products, and experiences. Memory can be categorized into different types:

1. Sensory Memory

üîπ Definition: Stores information from senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) for a very short duration (a few milliseconds to a few seconds).
üîπ Role in Consumer Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Influences first impressions of a product or advertisement.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Seeing a bright Coca-Cola billboard or hearing a catchy McDonald‚Äôs jingle.

üîπ Definition: Temporarily holds small amounts of information for a brief period (15-30 seconds).
üîπ Role in Consumer Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Consumers use it while browsing online, shopping in a store, or comparing options.
	‚Ä¢	If the information is repeated or engaging, it may move to long-term memory.
	‚Ä¢	Example: A consumer quickly remembers a 20% discount after seeing a banner ad but forgets it soon after if not reinforced.

3. Long-Term Memory

üîπ Definition: Stores information permanently and can be retrieved later.
üîπ Types:
	‚Ä¢	Explicit Memory (Conscious)
	‚Ä¢	Episodic Memory: Personal experiences, emotions (e.g., remembering your first visit to Disneyland).
	‚Ä¢	Semantic Memory: General knowledge, facts (e.g., knowing Nike is a sportswear brand).
	‚Ä¢	Implicit Memory (Unconscious)
	‚Ä¢	Consumers remember brands/products unconsciously due to repeated exposure.
	‚Ä¢	Example: A person instinctively choosing Colgate because they‚Äôve seen its ads over the years.

4. Brand Memory (Marketing Perspective)

	‚Ä¢	Brand Recognition: Ability to recognize a brand when seen/heard (e.g., recognizing McDonald‚Äôs golden arches).
